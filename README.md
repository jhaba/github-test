# Foreword

In the fall of 2016, the Nasher Sculpture Center announced an open call for graduate papers addressing themes within the work of the 2017 Nasher Prize Laureate Pierre Huyghe, for the inaugural Nasher Prize Graduate Symposium. One of the chief aims of the Nasher Prize is to further scholarship on contemporary sculpture, both through a careful look at the work of each laureate, as well as through conversations held around the world about sculptural practice in general, in all the various ways it is currently manifest— from objects to installations to video and sound, and much more, and the Graduate Symposium is a major way we hope to do that. Hosting this inaugural symposium on the dynamic work of French artist Pierre Huyghe seems entirely appropriate, since there is much to explore and unpack within his exciting oeuvre, which encompasses a variety of materials and disciplines, bringing music, cinema, dance, and theater into contact with biology and philosophy, and incorporating time-based elements.

Huyghe has consistently sought new ways to bring together unconventional and heterogeneous materials into a practice exceeding the sum of its many parts, and the Nasher Prize Graduate Symposium offers students from any academic discipline a chance to present their scholarly work to a broad audience of art historians and museum professionals, and to receive feedback from fellow presenters, the keynote speaker, and audience members on a host of questions and topics related to Huyghe’s dynamic work. In subsequent years, each new laureate will likewise be considered by students at the Nasher Prize Graduate Symposium.

We were so fortunate in this inaugural year to secure renowned art critic, curator, and Director of La Pancée art center, Montpellier, France, Nicolas Bourriaud, as the 2017 Nasher Prize Graduate Symposium keynote speaker. Bourriaud is perhaps most well-known for coining the term Relational Aesthetics, which is used to describe artistic practice that is interactive, performative, or related to a social context rather than a private space, and the work of Huyghe, because it so often involves the participation of the viewer or living systems, often falls within this rubric. We are also grateful to Pavel Pyś, Curator of Visual Art at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, who adroitly moderated the conversations here at the Nasher during this inaugural event in March 2017.

Many thanks, as well, to the Nasher Prize sponsors who made the Nasher Prize Graduate Symposium possible, especially: JPMorgan Chase & Co., The Dallas Foundation, The Eugene McDermott Foundation, Nancy A. Nasher and David J. Haemisegger, The Donna Wilhelm Family Fund, Nancy Rogers, The Heart of Neiman Marcus Foundation, and the Cultural Services of the French Embassy.

Finally, our sincere thanks to each of the remarkable students who presented papers for this inaugural event. We look forward to your continued successes, as well as similar excellence from all of our future participants.
